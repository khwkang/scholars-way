            The Scholarâ€™s Way library exists as database for information on our
            perspective and practice of medicinal, martial, and meditative arts;
            rooted in traditional wisdom and made accessible for contemporary
            students. The library serves as a reference for people who have been
            to our classes or clinic, as well as those simply interested in
            better understanding the process of healing and self-development.
