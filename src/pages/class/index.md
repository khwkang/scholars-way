  - title: Qigong
    description:
      Challenge yourself to self-heal. This ancient, fairly intense form of qigong serves as KoBang’s basic healing practice. Circulating qi (energy/breath of life) through the body in stationary, standing positions, our intent is to increase concentration, stamina, bone density and bone marrow production of blood cells. Even in seemingly still positions, we attain a perspiring workout doing this form of qigong. When we circulates qi, we energize all the body meridians referred to in classical Oriental medicine.

  - title: Kendo Basics
    description: 
      Kendo translates as “way of the sword” in Japanese. For this class, the intention is to enhance healthy reflexes, coordination and balance. The basic disciplines and moves of Kendo’s bamboo sword, supplemented by the foam sword, can provide an effective cross-training to qigong. The swifter movement and lightness of foot of Kendo counterbalance qigong’s long-held poses. While full development of Kendo results in a martial art or sports-like sparring, health is the goal of this class. Teacher approval in advance required to attend class
