  Kendo translates as “way of the sword” in Japanese. For this class, the intention is to enhance healthy reflexes, coordination and balance. The basic disciplines and moves of Kendo’s bamboo sword, supplemented by the foam sword, can provide an effective cross-training to qigong. The swifter movement and lightness of foot of Kendo counterbalance qigong’s long-held poses. While full development of Kendo results in a martial art or sports-like sparring, health is the goal of this class. Teacher approval in advance required to attend class.
