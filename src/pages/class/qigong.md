<p>Challenge yourself to self-heal. This ancient, fairly intense form of qigong serves as KoBangâ€™s basic healing practice. Circulating qi (energy/breath of life) through the body in stationary, standing positions, our intent is to increase concentration, stamina, bone density and bone marrow production of blood cells. Even in seemingly still positions, we attain a perspiring workout doing this form of qigong. When we circulates qi, we energize all the body meridians referred to in classical Oriental medicine.</p>
