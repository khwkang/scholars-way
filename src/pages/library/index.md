The Scholar’s Way library exists as database for information on our perspective and practice of medicinal, martial, and meditative arts; rooted in traditional wisdom and made accessible for contemporary students. The library serves as a reference for people who have been to our classes or clinic, as well as those simply interested in better understanding the process of healing and self-development.
